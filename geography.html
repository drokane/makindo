  <h2>🌍 Geography Top Tips</h2>
<ul>
<li><span class="tip">Use Case Studies:</span> Learn 2–3 facts for each case study and practise applying them.</li>
<li><span class="tip">Revise Key Diagrams:</span> Know the water cycle, coastal features, urban models, etc.</li>
<li><span class="tip">Use Keywords Precisely:</span> Terms like erosion, weathering, urbanisation, and sustainability must be accurate.</li>
<li><span class="tip">Practise Map and Data Skills:</span> Use OS maps, graphs, and statistical interpretation exercises.</li>
<li><span class="tip">Answer Command Words Effectively:</span> Learn to respond to 'describe', 'explain', 'evaluate' with structure.</li>
</ul>

  <h2>🗺️ GCSE Geography</h2>
<ul>
<li><span class="tip">Understand Key Themes:</span> The course is split into Physical Geography (e.g. natural hazards, rivers, coasts, ecosystems) and Human Geography (e.g. urban issues, development, resource management).</li>
<li><span class="tip">Use Case Studies Wisely:</span> Memorise 1–2 case studies per topic. Know facts, dates, statistics, causes, effects, responses, and evaluations (e.g. Haiti Earthquake, Rio de Janeiro, London regeneration).</li>
<li><span class="tip">Use the Command Words:</span> Understand what ‘describe’, ‘explain’, ‘compare’, and ‘evaluate’ require. Tailor your answers accordingly and plan extended responses.</li>
<li><span class="tip">Practise Map and Graph Skills:</span> Be confident reading OS maps, using grid references, measuring distances, interpreting bar/pie charts and choropleth maps.</li>
<li><span class="tip">Revise Fieldwork:</span> Recall the hypothesis, methods, data collection, presentation, and conclusions of your two fieldwork investigations — one human, one physical.</li>
<li><span class="tip">Structure 6- and 9-Mark Answers:</span> Use PEEL (Point, Evidence, Explain, Link) and offer balanced views with clear conclusions.</li>
<li><span class="tip">Watch for Synoptic Links:</span> Be prepared to link across topics — for example, how urban growth affects climate or water resources.</li>
<li><span class="tip">Use Real Data:</span> Refer to statistics or locations in your answers — this boosts credibility and marks.</li>
<li><span class="tip">Flashcards Help With Key Terms:</span> Definitions of processes (e.g. erosion, deposition, urbanisation) often form the basis of questions.</li>
<li><span class="tip">Practice Past Papers:</span> Get familiar with timing, question types, and structure by using real exam board resources.</li>
</ul>
