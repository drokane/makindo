  <h2>🌍 Geography Top Tips</h2>
<ul>
<li><span class="tip">Use Case Studies:</span> Learn 2–3 facts for each case study and practise applying them.</li>
<li><span class="tip">Revise Key Diagrams:</span> Know the water cycle, coastal features, urban models, etc.</li>
<li><span class="tip">Use Keywords Precisely:</span> Terms like erosion, weathering, urbanisation, and sustainability must be accurate.</li>
<li><span class="tip">Practise Map and Data Skills:</span> Use OS maps, graphs, and statistical interpretation exercises.</li>
<li><span class="tip">Answer Command Words Effectively:</span> Learn to respond to 'describe', 'explain', 'evaluate' with structure.</li>
</ul>

  <h2>🗺️ GCSE Geography</h2>
<ul>
<li><span class="tip">Understand Key Themes:</span> The course is split into Physical Geography (e.g. natural hazards, rivers, coasts, ecosystems) and Human Geography (e.g. urban issues, development, resource management).</li>
<li><span class="tip">Use Case Studies Wisely:</span> Memorise 1–2 case studies per topic. Know facts, dates, statistics, causes, effects, responses, and evaluations (e.g. Haiti Earthquake, Rio de Janeiro, London regeneration).</li>
<li><span class="tip">Use the Command Words:</span> Understand what ‘describe’, ‘explain’, ‘compare’, and ‘evaluate’ require. Tailor your answers accordingly and plan extended responses.</li>
<li><span class="tip">Practise Map and Graph Skills:</span> Be confident reading OS maps, using grid references, measuring distances, interpreting bar/pie charts and choropleth maps.</li>
<li><span class="tip">Revise Fieldwork:</span> Recall the hypothesis, methods, data collection, presentation, and conclusions of your two fieldwork investigations — one human, one physical.</li>
<li><span class="tip">Structure 6- and 9-Mark Answers:</span> Use PEEL (Point, Evidence, Explain, Link) and offer balanced views with clear conclusions.</li>
<li><span class="tip">Watch for Synoptic Links:</span> Be prepared to link across topics — for example, how urban growth affects climate or water resources.</li>
<li><span class="tip">Use Real Data:</span> Refer to statistics or locations in your answers — this boosts credibility and marks.</li>
<li><span class="tip">Flashcards Help With Key Terms:</span> Definitions of processes (e.g. erosion, deposition, urbanisation) often form the basis of questions.</li>
<li><span class="tip">Practice Past Papers:</span> Get familiar with timing, question types, and structure by using real exam board resources.</li>
</ul>

  <h2>🌋 Natural Hazards</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><span class="tip">Tectonic Hazards:</span> Earthquakes and volcanoes occur at plate boundaries. LICs suffer greater impact due to weaker infrastructure.</li>
    <li><span class="tip">Tropical Storms:</span> Form over warm oceans. Bring high winds, heavy rain, storm surges. Climate change may increase intensity.</li>
    <li><span class="tip">UK Weather Hazards:</span> Includes storms, flooding, snow, heatwaves. Caused by changing air masses and shifting jet stream.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="subject-block">
  <h2>🌍 Climate Change</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><span class="tip">Evidence:</span> Ice cores, global temperature rise, shrinking glaciers, rising sea levels.</li>
    <li><span class="tip">Causes:</span> Natural: volcanic activity, sunspots. Human: burning fossil fuels, deforestation, farming.</li>
    <li><span class="tip">Effects:</span> Rising sea levels, extreme weather, threats to biodiversity, impacts on farming and water supply.</li>
    <li><span class="tip">Responses:</span> Mitigation (reduce causes) and adaptation (adjust to changes).</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="subject-block">
  <h2>🌳 Ecosystems & Biomes</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><span class="tip">Ecosystems:</span> Local-scale systems of interdependent living and non-living components (e.g., pond, woodland).</li>
    <li><span class="tip">Rainforests:</span> High biodiversity, poor soils. Deforestation for farming, logging, mining. Managed by ecotourism, replanting, education.</li>
    <li><span class="tip">Hot Deserts:</span> Low rainfall, extreme temperatures. Plants and animals are adapted to conserve water. Threatened by desertification.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="subject-block">
  <h2>🏞️ UK Landscapes (Rivers & Coasts)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><span class="tip">Rivers:</span> Upper course: steep, V-shaped valleys. Middle: meanders. Lower: floodplains, levees. Flood management: soft and hard engineering.</li>
    <li><span class="tip">Coasts:</span> Erosion forms cliffs, arches, stacks. Deposition forms beaches and spits. Managed using groynes, sea walls, beach nourishment.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="subject-block">
  <h2>🏙️ Urban Issues & Challenges</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><span class="tip">Urban Growth:</span> LIC/NEE cities face rapid growth, informal housing, and resource pressure. Example: Rio de Janeiro or Lagos.</li>
    <li><span class="tip">Urban Change in the UK:</span> Regeneration of brownfield sites, transport development, housing shortages. Example: London or Birmingham.</li>
    <li><span class="tip">Sustainable Urban Living:</span> Managing water, waste, transport. Example: Freiburg or Curitiba.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="subject-block">
  <h2>🌐 Changing Economic World</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><span class="tip">Development Gap:</span> LICs vs HICs. Measured by GNI, HDI, life expectancy. Reduced through aid, trade, tourism, investment.</li>
    <li><span class="tip">Case Study LIC/NEE:</span> Nigeria or India — industrial growth, TNCs, environmental and social impact.</li>
    <li><span class="tip">UK Economy:</span> Deindustrialisation, rise of the service sector, science parks, transport improvements.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="subject-block">
  <h2>💧 Resource Management</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><span class="tip">Global Resource Inequality:</span> Uneven access to water, food, and energy. LICs face shortages due to infrastructure and climate.</li>
    <li><span class="tip">Water Management:</span> Dams, reservoirs, water transfer, conservation. Case studies include the UK and LIC/NEE examples.</li>
    <li><span class="tip">Food and Energy:</span> Issues of overconsumption and undernutrition. Sustainable strategies include local sourcing, renewables.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="subject-block">
  <h2>🧭 Fieldwork & Geographical Skills</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><span class="tip">Fieldwork:</span> Two enquiries — one human (e.g., shopping patterns), one physical (e.g., river study). Must know how data was collected, presented, and evaluated.</li>
    <li><span class="tip">Skills:</span> Use of OS maps, grid references, scale, direction. Interpretation of graphs, photos, and data analysis.</li>
    <li><span class="tip">Decision-Making:</span> Justify geographical choices using evidence and case studies (in Paper 3 for some boards).</li>
  </ul>
