    <li><span class="tip">Microscopy:</span> Use light and electron microscopes to compare resolution and magnification. Know how to prepare slides and calculate image size.</li>
    <li><span class="tip">Cell Division:</span> Mitosis produces identical cells for growth and repair. Stem cells can differentiate and are used in medicine.</li>
    <li><span class="tip">Transport:</span> Diffusion, osmosis, and active transport are key methods by which substances move in and out of cells.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="subject-block">
  <h2>üß´ Organisation</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><span class="tip">Cell Organisation:</span> Cells ‚Üí Tissues ‚Üí Organs ‚Üí Organ systems. Each level works together to maintain function.</li>
    <li><span class="tip">Digestive System:</span> Enzymes (amylase, protease, lipase) break down food. Bile emulsifies fat and neutralises acid.</li>
    <li><span class="tip">Circulatory System:</span> Double circulatory system transports oxygen and nutrients. Includes heart, blood vessels, and blood components.</li>
    <li><span class="tip">Disease:</span> Communicable and non-communicable diseases; risk factors include lifestyle, environment, and genetics.</li>
    <li><span class="tip">Cancer:</span> Caused by uncontrolled cell growth. Know the difference between benign and malignant tumours.</li>
