    <h2>ðŸ§¬ Biology Top Tips</h2>
    <div w3-include-html="content.html"></div>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="tip">Use Labeled Diagrams:</span> Great for cells, organs, enzymes, and cycles.</li>
      <li><span class="tip">Learn Key Definitions Exactly:</span> Like osmosis, diffusion, homeostasis â€” accuracy matters.</li>
      <li><span class="tip">Understand the Big Ideas:</span> Don't just memorise â€” know how and why processes work.</li>
      <li><span class="tip">Practise Required Practicals:</span> Be ready to describe steps, variables, and improvements.</li>
      <li><span class="tip">Use Flashcards for Processes:</span> Perfect for inheritance, mitosis, photosynthesis, etc.</li>
      <li><span class="tip">Revise Organ Systems in Context:</span> Link structure to function (e.g., lungs and gas exchange).</li>
      <li><span class="tip">Link Topics Together:</span> Biology connects â€” digestion links to enzymes, respiration to circulation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>ðŸ“˜ GCSE Biology Essentials</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="tip">Master Cell Biology:</span> Know the differences between plant, animal, and bacterial cells. Understand cell structure, mitosis, and specialisation.</li>
      <li><span class="tip">Understand Organisation:</span> Learn the hierarchy of cells â†’ tissues â†’ organs â†’ systems. Know the digestive, circulatory, and respiratory systems in detail.</li>
      <li><span class="tip">Learn Key Processes:</span> Photosynthesis and respiration (aerobic and anaerobic) are essential â€” equations, stages, and limiting factors.</li>
      <li><span class="tip">Revise Homeostasis:</span> Understand regulation of blood glucose, body temperature, and water levels â€” including insulin, ADH, and negative feedback.</li>
      <li><span class="tip">Grasp Genetics Clearly:</span> Be confident with Punnett squares, dominant/recessive traits, inherited disorders, and the structure of DNA.</li>
      <li><span class="tip">Know Evolution & Ecology:</span> Natural selection, classification, the carbon cycle, biodiversity, and food chains are frequent exam topics.</li>
      <li><span class="tip">Use Required Practicals:</span> Know the method, variables, and results for osmosis, enzyme activity, and field sampling, among others.</li>
      <li><span class="tip">Get Familiar with Data:</span> Biology often tests your ability to interpret graphs, tables, and trends â€” practise with exam-style questions.</li>
      <li><span class="tip">Memorise Key Terms:</span> Learn definitions for diffusion, active transport, pathogen, antibody, vaccine, etc. â€” precise wording matters.</li>
      <li><span class="tip">Apply Concepts to Scenarios:</span> Many biology questions are applied â€” practise linking your knowledge to unfamiliar contexts.</li>
    </ul>
