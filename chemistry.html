    <h2>⚗️ Chemistry Top Tips</h2>
<ul>
<li><span class="tip">Learn Common Ions and Symbols:</span> You'll need these for writing chemical equations.</li>
<li><span class="tip">Balance Equations Frequently:</span> This is a must-have skill for exams.</li>
<li><span class="tip">Revise Bonding Types:</span> Understand the structure and properties of ionic, covalent and metallic bonding.</li>
<li><span class="tip">Practise with Required Practicals:</span> Know the methods and what each step is testing.</li>
<li><span class="tip">Work on Moles and Calculations:</span> Show your steps clearly — avoid skipping logic.</li>
<li><span class="tip">Understand Periodic Trends:</span> Know what happens to reactivity across and down the table.</li>
<li><span class="tip">Use Real Exam Questions:</span> Chemistry mark schemes are very specific — practise phrasing.</li>

  <h2>⚗️ GCSE Chemistry</h2>
<ul>
<li><span class="tip">Atomic Structure:</span> Understand protons, neutrons, electrons, atomic and mass numbers, and electronic configurations.</li>
<li><span class="tip">Periodic Table Trends:</span> Know why elements are arranged by atomic number and grouped by reactivity — especially groups 1, 7, and 0.</li>
<li><span class="tip">Bonding & Structure:</span> Be able to compare ionic, covalent, and metallic bonding. Draw dot-and-cross diagrams accurately.</li>
<li><span class="tip">Chemical Equations:</span> Practise balancing equations and identifying reactants, products, and state symbols.</li>
<li><span class="tip">Quantitative Chemistry:</span> Master mole calculations, mass, concentration, and percentage yield questions.</li>
<li><span class="tip">Acids and Bases:</span> Learn the pH scale, reactions of acids with bases and metals, and the importance of titration.</li>
<li><span class="tip">Electrolysis:</span> Understand how and why electrolysis separates ionic substances — and apply it to practical and industrial processes.</li>
<li><span class="tip">Energy Changes:</span> Distinguish between exothermic and endothermic reactions, and interpret energy profile diagrams.</li>
<li><span class="tip">Rates of Reaction:</span> Learn collision theory and how temperature, concentration, pressure, and catalysts affect rate.</li>
<li><span class="tip">Earth and Atmospheric Science:</span> Know how the Earth's atmosphere evolved, the carbon cycle, and the impact of human activity.</li>
</ul>
