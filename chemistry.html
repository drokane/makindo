  <h2>‚öõÔ∏è Basic Notes on Atomic Structure</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><span class="tip">Atoms:</span> The smallest units of matter, consisting of a nucleus and electrons.</li>
    <li><span class="tip">Protons:</span> Positively charged particles found in the nucleus. üî¥ Relative charge: +1, Relative mass: 1.</li>
    <li><span class="tip">Neutrons:</span> Neutral particles in the nucleus. ‚ö™ Relative charge: 0, Relative mass: 1.</li>
    <li><span class="tip">Electrons:</span> Negatively charged particles orbiting the nucleus. üîµ Relative charge: -1, Relative mass: ~0.</li>
    <li><span class="tip">Atomic Number (Z):</span> The number of protons in an atom. It defines the element.</li>
    <li><span class="tip">Mass Number (A):</span> The total number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus.</li>
    <li><span class="tip">Electronic Configuration:</span> Describes how electrons are arranged in shells. e.g., Oxygen = 2,6.</li>
    <li><span class="tip">Isotopes:</span> Atoms of the same element with the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>üß™ Periodic Table ‚Äì Key Points</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><span class="tip">Groups:</span> Vertical columns. Elements in the same group have similar chemical properties and the same number of outer electrons.</li>
    <li><span class="tip">Periods:</span> Horizontal rows. Each new period represents a new electron shell.</li>
    <li><span class="tip">Metals vs Non-Metals:</span> Metals are on the left and centre; non-metals are on the right. Metals tend to lose electrons, non-metals gain them.</li>
    <li><span class="tip">Group 1 ‚Äì Alkali Metals:</span> Soft, reactive metals. Reactivity increases down the group.</li>
    <li><span class="tip">Group 7 ‚Äì Halogens:</span> Very reactive non-metals. Reactivity decreases down the group.</li>
    <li><span class="tip">Group 0 ‚Äì Noble Gases:</span> Unreactive gases with full outer shells. They are inert and stable.</li>
    <li><span class="tip">Transition Metals:</span> Found in the middle block. They form coloured compounds and can have multiple oxidation states.</li>
  </ul>

 <div class="subject-block">
  <h2>üîó Bonding and Structure</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><span class="tip">Ionic Bonding:</span> Between metals and non-metals. Electrons are transferred from metal to non-metal to form ions. Strong electrostatic forces hold ions in a lattice.</li>
    <li><span class="tip">Covalent Bonding:</span> Between non-metals. Atoms share electrons to achieve full outer shells. Found in molecules like H‚ÇÇO, CO‚ÇÇ, and O‚ÇÇ.</li>
    <li><span class="tip">Metallic Bonding:</span> In metals. Positive metal ions surrounded by a sea of delocalised electrons. Explains conductivity and malleability.</li>
    <li><span class="tip">Simple Molecular Structures:</span> Low melting/boiling points due to weak intermolecular forces (e.g., H‚ÇÇ, CH‚ÇÑ, H‚ÇÇO).</li>
    <li><span class="tip">Giant Covalent Structures:</span> High melting points and hardness (e.g., diamond, graphite, silicon dioxide).</li>
    <li><span class="tip">Polymers:</span> Long chains of repeating units. Properties depend on the forces between the chains (e.g., poly(ethene)).</li>
    <li><span class="tip">Alloys:</span> Mixtures of metals. Disrupt regular arrangement to make materials harder (e.g., steel, bronze).</li>
