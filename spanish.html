  <h2>ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸ GCSE Spanish</h2>
<ul>
<li><span class="tip">Build Core Vocabulary:</span> Use topic-based lists to revise terms for family, technology, free time, environment, education, and future plans.</li>
<li><span class="tip">Master Verb Tenses:</span> Present, preterite, imperfect, future, and conditional tenses are essential. Pay special attention to irregulars like ser, ir, tener, and hacer.</li>
<li><span class="tip">Practise Listening:</span> Listen to native Spanish (YouTube, podcasts, BBC Bitesize) to improve comprehension and pick up pronunciation.</li>
<li><span class="tip">Writing Tips:</span> Structure 90- and 150-word answers with time frames, opinions (pienso que), comparisons, and varied sentence starters.</li>
<li><span class="tip">Speaking Confidence:</span> Use past photo cards and role plays to rehearse aloud. Practise answers to questions about daily life, holidays, school, and ambitions.</li>
<li><span class="tip">Use Connectives and Intensifiers:</span> Words like porque, sin embargo, ademÃ¡s, muy, bastante add fluency and earn higher marks.</li>
<li><span class="tip">Revise Theme Content:</span> Focus on AQAâ€™s three themes: Identity & Culture, Local/Global Issues, and Education/Employment.</li>
<li><span class="tip">Check Gender and Agreement:</span> Always ensure adjectives agree in number and gender with the noun â€” this is a common error!</li>
<li><span class="tip">Practise Reading with Purpose:</span> Look for gist, scan for details, and recognise false friends and distractors in multiple-choice formats.</li>
<li><span class="tip">Work on Pronunciation:</span> Pay attention to accents, syllable stress, and sounds like Ã±, ll, j, and rolled r.</li>
</ul>
