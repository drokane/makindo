    <li><span class="tip">OCR 21st Century:</span> Less common. More thematic and less modular. Focuses on science in society and how science is developed and applied.</li>
    <li><span class="tip">WJEC Eduqas:</span> Used mainly in Wales. Includes extended writing and slightly more focus on sustainability and ethical issues in science. The question style often blends multiple topics.</li>
    <li><span class="tip">Content Similarities:</span> All boards cover the same core topics: energy, electricity, particles, atomic structure, forces, waves, magnetism, and (for Triple) space physics.</li>
    <li><span class="tip">Key Differences:</span> Mainly in how content is assessed, how practicals are described, and the types of extended response or data-handling questions included.</li>
