  <h2>ðŸ”­ GCSE Physics</h2>
<ul>
<li><span class="tip">Learn the Core Equations:</span> Memorise key formulas (e.g., v = fÎ», F = ma, E = mcÎ”Î¸, P = IV) and practise rearranging them.</li>
<li><span class="tip">Understand Forces:</span> Know how to calculate resultant forces, and interpret distance-time and velocity-time graphs.</li>
<li><span class="tip">Grasp Energy Concepts:</span> Understand energy stores, conservation of energy, efficiency, and Sankey diagrams.</li>
<li><span class="tip">Study Electricity Thoroughly:</span> Master Ohmâ€™s law, series vs. parallel circuits, resistance, and power calculations.</li>
<li><span class="tip">Explore Waves:</span> Know properties of transverse and longitudinal waves, and understand reflection, refraction, and the EM spectrum.</li>
<li><span class="tip">Learn Atomic Physics:</span> Understand nuclear decay, half-life, types of radiation, and safety precautions.</li>
<li><span class="tip">Use Required Practicals:</span> Be ready to describe and interpret experiments â€” e.g. specific heat capacity, resistance, light and sound.</li>
<li><span class="tip">Apply Maths Skills:</span> Use standard form, unit conversions, significant figures, and graph interpretation fluently.</li>
<li><span class="tip">Revise Space Physics (if triple):</span> Study life cycle of stars, orbits, red-shift, and evidence for the Big Bang.</li>
<li><span class="tip">Practice Real Questions:</span> Use past papers to get used to multi-step calculations and explaining unfamiliar contexts clearly.</li>
